  My research interests align in investigating novel methods merging <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, <strong>Program Analysis</strong>, <strong>Software Accessibility</strong>, and <strong>Software Testing</strong> for robust, secure software development. Bridging theory with practice through empirical studies and tool development to enhance software reliability and efficiency.
